# Quest System Documentation

## Overview
The quest system allows players to accept quests from NPCs, complete objectives, and earn rewards. Quests can be solo or group-based (party quests), repeatable or one-time, and can have prerequisites.

### Turn In Quest
Simply **talk to the quest NPC** after completing all objectives. The quest will automatically turn in and rewards will be awarded.

## Quest Flow

### 1. Quest Availability
A quest is available if:
- Quest giver NPC is in the player's current room
- Player meets level requirement (`levelRequired`)
- Player has completed all prerequisite quests (`prerequisites`)
- Quest is not already active
- Quest has not been completed (or is repeatable)

### 2. Quest Acceptance
When player accepts a quest:
- Quest is added to `player.activeQuests` array
- Objectives are initialized with `current: 0`
- Player is notified of quest objectives

### 3. Progress Tracking
Objectives automatically update when:
- **Kill**: Player defeats a monster (tracked in combat system)
- **Collect**: Player picks up an item with `get` command
- **Visit**: Player enters a room with `go` command
- **Talk**: Player talks to an NPC with `talk` command

### 4. Quest Completion
When all objectives reach their count:
- Player is notified that objectives are complete
- Player is told to return to turn-in NPC

### 5. Quest Turn-In
When player talks to turn-in NPC after completing objectives:
- Quest is removed from `activeQuests`
- Quest ID is added to `completedQuests` (unless repeatable)
- Rewards are automatically awarded:
  - XP added to player
  - Gold added to player
  - Items added to inventory
- Level-up check is performed if XP was awarded

}
```

All fields are optional:

## Prerequisites

Quests can require other quests to be completed first:
```json
{
  "prerequisites": ["quest-tutorial", "quest-first-monster"]
}
```

Players must have completed ALL prerequisite quests before the quest becomes available.

## Repeatable Quests

Set `isRepeatable: true` to allow players to complete the quest multiple times. Repeatable quests:
- Can be accepted again after completion
- Are NOT added to `completedQuests` list
- Can be used for daily/weekly tasks or grinding

## Party Quests

`isPartyQuest: true` enables party quest functionality. Party quests:
- ‚úÖ **Implemented** - Fully functional party system
- ‚úÖ Can be accepted by any party member
- ‚úÖ Progress is shared among ALL party members in real-time
- ‚úÖ All party members receive full rewards when quest is completed
- ‚úÖ Works with all objective types (kill, collect, visit, talk)
- See **PARTY_SYSTEM.md** for detailed party and party quest documentation

Example party quest:
```json
{
  "id": "quest-raid-dungeon",
  "title": "Raid the Ancient Dungeon",
  "isPartyQuest": true,
  "levelRequired": 10,
  "objectives": [
    {"type": "kill", "target": "dungeon-boss", "count": 1}
  ],
  "rewards": {
    "xp": 2000,
    "gold": 500,
    "items": ["legendary-armor"]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Quest IDs**: Use descriptive IDs with `quest-` prefix (e.g., `quest-dragon-slayer`)
2. **Level Scaling**: Set appropriate level requirements for quest difficulty
3. **Reward Balance**: XP rewards should scale with quest difficulty and level requirement
4. **Quest Chains**: Use prerequisites to create story progression
5. **Objective Clarity**: Use clear, specific target names that match game entities
6. **Repeatable Quests**: Good for resource gathering, daily tasks, or grinding
7. **Turn-in NPCs**: Can be different from giver for delivery quests
8. **Testing**: Always test quest flow from accept ‚Üí complete ‚Üí turn-in

## Future Enhancements

- **Party Quest System**: Share progress and rewards among party members
- **Quest Timers**: Time-limited quests
- **Quest Stages**: Multi-stage quests with intermediate checkpoints
- **Quest Dialogue**: Custom NPC dialogue for quest states (available, active, complete)
- **Quest Markers**: Visual indicators for quest NPCs
- **Quest Journal UI**: Dedicated UI panel for quest tracking
- **Achievement Integration**: Quests that grant achievements
- **Quest Chains UI**: Visual representation of quest prerequisites
