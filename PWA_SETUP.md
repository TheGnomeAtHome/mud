# PWA Setup Guide - MUD Game

Your MUD game is now configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA)!

## What This Means

Users can now:
- **Install your game** like a native app
- **Play from home screen** with an app icon
- **Work offline** (basic functionality cached)
- **No app store needed** - install directly from browser

---

## Files to Upload to Server

Upload these new files to your server at `/mud/`:

### Required Files:
1. ‚úÖ **manifest.json** - App configuration
2. ‚úÖ **service-worker.js** - Offline caching
3. ‚úÖ **offline.html** - Offline fallback page
4. ‚úÖ **mud.html** (v021) - Updated with PWA integration

### Optional but Recommended:
5. üìÅ **icons/** folder - App icons (see icons/README.md)

## Checking Service Worker Registration

After uploading files:

1. Open your game in Chrome
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools

## What Works Offline

With the service worker cached:
- ‚úÖ Basic UI loads
- ‚úÖ Can see character data (if previously loaded)
- ‚ùå Real-time multiplayer (requires internet)
- ‚ùå Firebase authentication (requires internet)
- ‚ùå AI features (requires internet)

## Customization Options

### manifest.json - App Settings

You can customize:

```json
{
  "name": "Multi-User Dungeon",        // Full app name
  "short_name": "MUD",                  // Home screen label
  "description": "Your description",    // App description
  "theme_color": "#00ff41",            // Status bar color
  "background_color": "#0d0d0d",       // Splash screen background
  "start_url": "/mud/mud.html"         // Where app opens
}
```

### service-worker.js - Caching

Currently caches:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript files
- External fonts and libraries

Skips caching:
- Firebase API calls
- Google Gemini AI calls

You can add more files to cache in the `urlsToCache` array.

## Updating the PWA

When you make changes:

1. **Update files on server** as usual
2. **Update CACHE_NAME** in service-worker.js:
   ```javascript
   const CACHE_NAME = 'mud-game-v2'; // Increment version
   ```
3. **Upload service-worker.js**
4. Users will automatically get updates on next visit

The service worker checks for updates automatically.

## Creating App Icons

### Quick Method (5 minutes):

1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload a 512x512 image (your game logo/design)
3. Click "Generate" - creates all sizes
4. Download and extract to `/mud/icons/` folder
5. Upload to server

### Icon Design Suggestions:

**Simple "MUD" Logo:**
- Black background (#0d0d0d)
- Green "MUD" text (#00ff41) in VT323 font
- Maybe add a small sword/dungeon icon

**Tools to Create:**
- https://www.photopea.com (free Photoshop)

## Troubleshooting

### "Add to Home Screen" doesn't appear

**Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ HTTPS connection (not HTTP)

- ‚úÖ At least one icon (192x192 or 512x512)

**Check:**
1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Manifest
2. Look for errors in red
3. Check Console for service worker errors

### Service Worker won't register

**Common fixes:**
1. Check file path: `/mud/service-worker.js`
2. Update cache paths in service-worker.js to match your structure
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### App won't update

1. Increment CACHE_NAME in service-worker.js
2. Upload new service-worker.js

## Future: Capacitor (Option 2)

When you're ready to publish to Google Play Store:

1. **Install Capacitor:**
   ```bash
   npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
   npx cap init
   ```

2. **Add Android platform:**
   ```bash
   npm install @capacitor/android
   npx cap add android
   ```

3. **Build APK:**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   npx cap open android
   ```

4. **Android Studio** opens ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Generate Signed Bundle/APK

Your PWA setup (manifest.json, service worker) will work perfectly with Capacitor!

‚úÖ **Push Notifications** - Can add later (with user permission)
‚úÖ **Smaller Size** - ~2MB vs ~50MB native app
‚úÖ **Auto-Updates** - No app store approval needed
‚úÖ **Cross-Platform** - Works on Android AND iOS

## Statistics & Testing

After setup, you can track:
- Number of installs
- App usage vs website usage
- Service worker cache hit rate

**Tools:**
- Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Application tab
- Lighthouse audit (in DevTools)
- Google Analytics (can track PWA installs)

## Questions?

The PWA is ready to go! Just upload the files and test.

**Next Steps:**
1. Upload 4 required files (manifest.json, service-worker.js, offline.html, mud.html)
2. Create icons using PWA Builder
3. Upload icons folder
4. Test installation on your phone
5. Share install instructions with players!

Your game now works as both:
- üåê Regular website (browser)
- üì± Installable app (PWA)

Same code, two experiences!
