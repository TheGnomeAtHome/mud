# Party System Documentation

## Overview
The party system allows players to team up, share quest progress, and work together on party quests. Parties have a leader who can manage membership, and all members benefit from shared quest objectives and rewards.

## Party Structure

## Party Quest Integration

### Shared Quest Progress
When a party member completes an objective on a **party quest**, ALL party members' progress is updated:

- **Kill objectives**: Any party member's kill counts for everyone
- **Collect objectives**: Any party member picking up items updates everyone
- **Visit objectives**: Any party member visiting a location updates everyone
- **Talk objectives**: Any party member talking to NPCs updates everyone

### Quest Acceptance
- Any party member can accept a party quest
- The quest becomes active for all members if they meet requirements
- Level requirements are checked individually

### Quest Rewards
When a party quest is completed and turned in:
- **ALL party members** receive the full rewards
- Each member gets: XP, gold, and items
- Party members in different rooms are notified
- Level-ups are checked for each member

### Party Quest Requirements
In the quest editor, set `isPartyQuest: true` to make a quest party-enabled:
```json
{
  "id": "quest-raid-dungeon",
  "title": "Raid the Ancient Dungeon",
  "isPartyQuest": true,
  "levelRequired": 10,
  "objectives": [
    {"type": "kill", "target": "dungeon-boss", "count": 1}
  ],
  "rewards": {
    "xp": 1000,
    "gold": 500,
    "items": ["legendary-armor"]
  }
}
```

## Party Management Flow

### 1. Forming a Party
```

```
# Any party member accepts quest

```

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structures

#### Player Party Tracking
Players are tracked by their presence in a party's `members` object:
```javascript
// Find player's party
const playerParty = Object.values(gameParties).find(p => 
    p.members && Object.keys(p.members).includes(userId)
);
```

#### Party Invitations
Pending invitations are stored in the party's `invitations` object:
```javascript
invitations: {
    "targetUserId": {
        name: "TargetPlayer",
        invitedAt: serverTimestamp(),
        invitedBy: "InviterName"
    }
}
```

### Quest Progress Sharing

When a party member makes quest progress:
1. The function `updateQuestProgress()` is called
2. It checks if the quest is a party quest (`isPartyQuest: true`)
3. If yes, it updates ALL party members' quest progress
4. All members are notified when objectives complete

```javascript
// Update party members' quest progress
if (questData && questData.isPartyQuest && playerParty) {
    for (const memberId of Object.keys(playerParty.members)) {
        // Update each member's activeQuests
        await updateDoc(memberRef, {
            activeQuests: updatedQuests
        });
    }
}
```

### Quest Turn-In Distribution

When a party quest is turned in:
1. All party members' quests are removed from active
2. All party members receive full rewards
3. Remote party members get system notifications
4. Level-ups are checked for each member individually

```javascript
const rewardRecipients = isPartyQuest 
    ? Object.keys(playerParty.members) 
    : [userId];

for (const recipientId of rewardRecipients) {
    // Award XP, gold, items to each recipient
    await updateDoc(recipientRef, updates);
    await checkLevelUp(recipientRef, updates.xp, level);
}
```

## Party Chat Implementation

Party chat messages are broadcast to all party members' current rooms:
```javascript
// Send to all party members
for (const memberId of Object.keys(playerParty.members)) {
    const member = gamePlayers[memberId];
    if (member && member.roomId) {
        await addDoc(collection(db, 'mud-messages'), {
            senderId: userId,
            senderName: playerName,
            roomId: member.roomId,
            text: message,
            isPartyChat: true,
            timestamp: serverTimestamp()
        });
    }
}
```

Messages are styled differently in the UI:
```javascript
if (msg.isPartyChat) {
    logToTerminal(`[Party] ${sender}: ${msg.text}`, 'party');
}
```

## Integration with Quest System

### Quest Acceptance Check
```javascript
// Party quests can be accepted by any party member
if (quest.isPartyQuest) {
    // Check if player is in a party
    const playerParty = Object.values(gameParties).find(p => 
        p.members && Object.keys(p.members).includes(userId)
    );
    
    if (!playerParty) {
        logToTerminal("This is a party quest. You need to be in a party.", "error");
        break;
    }
}
```

### Progress Updates
All four objective types support party sharing:
- **Kill**: Triggered in combat when monster defeated
- **Collect**: Triggered when item picked up with `get` command
- **Visit**: Triggered when entering room with `go` command
- **Talk**: Triggered when talking to NPC

Each trigger calls `updateQuestProgress(playerId, type, target)` which handles party distribution.

## Best Practices

1. **Party Size**: No hard limit, but 3-5 members is recommended for balanced gameplay
2. **Party Quests**: Design challenging quests that require teamwork
3. **Reward Scaling**: Party quest rewards can be higher since multiple players are working together
4. **Communication**: Encourage use of party chat for coordination
5. **Leadership**: Leader has control over membership - choose wisely
6. **Quest Design**: Use `isPartyQuest: true` for raids, dungeons, and group challenges

## Example Party Quest

### Dungeon Raid Quest
```json
{
  "id": "quest-crystal-caverns-raid",
  "title": "Crystal Caverns Raid",
  "description": "A powerful crystal guardian protects ancient treasure. Gather your party and defeat it!",
  "levelRequired": 15,
  "isRepeatable": false,
  "isPartyQuest": true,
  "giverNpcId": "expedition-leader",
  "objectives": [
    {"type": "visit", "room": "crystal-caverns", "count": 1},
    {"type": "kill", "target": "crystal-guardian", "count": 1},
    {"type": "collect", "item": "ancient-crystal", "count": 1}
  ],
  "rewards": {
    "xp": 2000,
    "gold": 1000,
    "items": ["crystal-sword", "crystal-armor"]
  },
  "prerequisites": ["quest-explore-caves"]
}
```

### Usage Flow

## Admin Features

### Monitoring Parties
Admins can view active parties using `party list` to see:
- How many parties are active
- Who the leaders are
- How many members in each party

### Future Enhancements
- **Party admin panel**: View and manage all parties in admin interface
- **Party size limits**: Configure max party size
- **Party roles**: Tank, healer, DPS role assignments
- **Party buffs**: Stat bonuses for being in a party

## AI Parser Support

The Gemini AI parser understands natural language party commands:
- "create a group" â†’ `{"action": "party", "target": "create"}`
- "invite Sarah to party" â†’ `{"action": "party", "target": "invite", "npc_target": "Sarah"}`
- "join John's team" â†’ `{"action": "party", "target": "join", "npc_target": "John"}`
- "leave the party" â†’ `{"action": "party", "target": "leave"}`
- "tell party we're ready" â†’ `{"action": "pc", "target": "we're ready"}`

Synonyms supported:
- "group" = "party"
- "team" = "party"

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Create Party
- âœ… Make sure you're not already in a party
- âœ… Use `party leave` first if needed

### Can't Invite Player
- âœ… You must be the party leader
- âœ… Target player must not be in another party
- âœ… Check spelling of player name

### Can't Join Party
- âœ… You must have a pending invitation
- âœ… Use exact leader's name
- âœ… Make sure you're not already in a party

### Quest Progress Not Sharing
- âœ… Check quest has `isPartyQuest: true`
- âœ… Verify all members accepted the quest
- âœ… Confirm all members are still in the party

### Party Chat Not Working
- âœ… You must be in a party to use `pc`
- âœ… Messages are sent to all party members' current rooms
- âœ… Recipients will see messages even if in different locations
