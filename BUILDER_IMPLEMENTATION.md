# Builder System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. Builder Commands (9 commands)
All commands added to `js/game.js`:

**Player Builder Commands:**
- `buildroom [id] [name]` - Create new rooms
- `editdesc [description]` - Edit room descriptions
- `addexit [direction] [room-id]` - Add exits
- `removeexit [direction]` - Remove exits
- `adddetail [keyword] [description]` - Add examinable details
- `builderrooms` - List your created rooms

**Admin Commands:**
- `makebuilder [player]` - Grant builder permissions
- `removebuilder [player]` - Revoke builder permissions
- `reviewrooms` - List pending rooms
- `approveroom [room-id]` - Approve a room
- `rejectroom [room-id]` - Reject/delete a room

### 2. Permission System
- New player property: `isBuilder` (boolean)
- Builders can only edit rooms they created
- Admins can edit any room
- Auto-approval for admin-created rooms
- Pending approval system for builder rooms

### 3. Room Properties
Extended room object with:
- `createdBy` - User ID of creator
- `createdAt` - Timestamp of creation
- `pending` - Approval status (true/false)
- `approvedBy` - Admin who approved
- `approvedAt` - Approval timestamp

### 4. Help Integration
- Builder commands appear in help when player has builder status
- Admin commands updated with builder management options
- Context-sensitive help display

### 5. Documentation
- **BUILDER_SYSTEM.md** - Complete guide (60+ pages worth)
- **BUILDER_QUICKSTART.md** - Quick reference cheat sheet

## 🔧 How It Works

### For Players:
1. Admin grants builder status: `makebuilder John`
2. Player creates room: `buildroom my-house My House`
3. Player customizes room with `editdesc`, `adddetail`
4. Room marked as pending approval
5. Admin reviews with `reviewrooms`
6. Admin approves: `approveroom my-house`
7. Player can now connect room with `addexit`
8. Room is live for all players!

### Technical Flow:
```
Player Command
    ↓
Permission Check (isBuilder or isAdmin)
    ↓
Validation (IDs, formats, ownership)
    ↓
MySQL API Call (with X-API-Key header)
    ↓
Local Cache Update (gameWorld object)
    ↓
User Feedback + Notifications
```

## 🎮 Integration Points

### Database (MySQL)
- All rooms stored via `https://jphsoftware.com/api/rooms`
- API key: `cu4s2YmwWdpMGZ8PfLaJC6RTje1FNSbO`
- CRUD operations: POST (create), PATCH (update), DELETE (reject)

### Firebase (Player Data)
- `isBuilder` field stored in `/mud-players/{userId}`
- Synced with `gamePlayers` cache
- Persistent across sessions

### Notifications
- In-game messages sent to builders on approval/rejection
- Uses `/mud-messages` collection
- Real-time delivery via existing message system

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Permission Checks:
- ✅ Builder status verified on every command
- ✅ Room ownership validated before edits
- ✅ Admins can override ownership checks
- ✅ Pending rooms cannot be connected until approved

### Input Validation:
- ✅ Room ID format: `^[a-z0-9-]+$`
- ✅ Duplicate ID prevention
- ✅ Target room existence checks
- ✅ Valid direction validation

### Approval System:
- ✅ Builder rooms auto-pending
- ✅ Admin rooms auto-approved
- ✅ Cannot add exits to pending rooms
- ✅ Manual admin review required

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Admins:
1. Grant builder status to trusted players:
   ```
   makebuilder PlayerName
   ```

2. Review pending rooms regularly:
   ```
   reviewrooms
   ```

3. Approve good rooms:
   ```
   approveroom room-id
   ```

### For New Builders:
1. Check you have builder status (type `help`)
2. Create your first room:
   ```
   buildroom test-room Test Room
   ```
3. Add description:
   ```
   editdesc This is my test room.
   ```
4. Wait for approval
5. Once approved, connect it:
   ```
   addexit south test-room
   ```

## 💡 Future Enhancements

Possible additions:
- **Builder quotas** - Limit rooms per builder
- **Room templates** - Pre-made room structures
- **Collaborative building** - Multiple builders on one room
- **Builder ranks** - Progression system
- **Bulk operations** - Edit multiple rooms
- **Room search** - Find rooms by keyword
- **Builder statistics** - Track contributions
- **Room copying** - Clone existing rooms as templates
- **Undo system** - Revert recent changes
- **Room previews** - Visit pending rooms

## 📝 Notes

### API Key Security
Currently hardcoded in commands. Consider moving to:
- Environment variable
- Server-side proxy
- Encrypted config file

### Known Limitations
- No undo for room deletion
- No room copying yet
- Cannot transfer room ownership
- No collaborative editing
- No version history

### Best Practices
- Review pending rooms within 24 hours
- Provide feedback when rejecting
- Encourage quality over quantity
- Create builder guidelines specific to your world
- Reward active builders

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"You need builder permissions"**
- Ask admin to run: `makebuilder YourName`

**"Room ID already exists"**
- Choose a different, unique ID

**"Cannot add exits to pending rooms"**
- Wait for admin approval first

**"You can only edit rooms you created"**
- This is by design - ask admin for help

**"Target room doesn't exist"**
- Check the room ID is correct
- Use `builderrooms` to see your rooms

   addexit south test-cottage
   ```

4. Grant trusted players builder access and watch your world grow!
