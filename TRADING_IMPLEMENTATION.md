## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Update Your NPCs

Add these properties to merchants in the admin panel:

**Required for selling:**
```json
{
  "sells": ["item-id-1", "item-id-2"],
  "haggleable": true
}
```

**Required for buying:**
```json
{
  "buys": ["all"],  // or specific categories
  "buyRate": 0.40   // Pay 40% of item value
}
```

**Optional enhancements:**
```json
{
  "greed": 0.10,              // Affects haggling difficulty
  "specialItems": ["rare-id"], // High-rep customers only
  "restockDay": 1,             // Monday restock
  "priceModifiers": {          // Item-specific pricing
    "sword": 1.2               // 20% more expensive
  }
}
```

### 2. Update Your Items

Add these properties to make items sellable:

```json
{
  "value": 50,           // How much it's worth (defaults to cost)
  "tradeable": true,     // Can be traded to players
  "rarity": "uncommon",  // Affects pricing
  "category": "weapons", // For merchant buy filters
  "bound": false         // If true, cannot be sold/traded
}
```

### 3. Deploy Files

**Required new files:**
- `js/trading.js`
- `js/player-trading.js`

**Modified files:**
- `js/game.js`
- `mud.html`

Run the update script:
```powershell
.\update-version.ps1
```

Then upload all files to your domain.

## 🎯 How It Works

### Haggling System

1. **Player initiates haggle:**
   ```
   > haggle 80 for sword from blacksmith
   ```

2. **System calculates success chance based on:**
   - Player's Charisma stat
   - Reputation with merchant
   - Discount amount requested
   - Merchant's greed level

3. **Possible outcomes:**
   - **Critical Success** (5%): Get even better deal!
   - **Success**: Get requested discount
   - **Counteroffer** (30%): Merchant meets halfway
   - **Failure**: Try again (3 attempts total)
   - **Critical Failure** (5%): Merchant refuses to trade!

4. **Player can:**
   - Accept counteroffer: `buy sword from blacksmith`
   - Try again: `haggle 85 for sword from blacksmith`
   - Give up: `cancel`

### Reputation System

**How reputation grows:**
- Buy item: +1 per 10 gold spent
- Sell item: +1 per 5 gold value
- Fair trade (no haggle): +2 bonus
- Successful haggle: +1
- Failed haggle: -1

**Reputation levels:**
```
Stranger (0-99)        → Base prices
Acquaintance (100-299) → 5% discount
Friend (300-599)       → 10% discount + rare items
Trusted (600-999)      → 15% discount + special quests
Partner (1000+)        → 20% discount + exclusive items
```

### Player Trading

1. **Player A requests:**
   ```
   > trade with PlayerB
   ```

2. **Player B accepts:**
   ```
   > accept trade
   ```

3. **Both add items/gold:**
   ```
   Player A: offer iron sword
   Player A: offer 50 gold
   Player B: offer health potion
   Player B: offer 100 gold
   ```

4. **Both confirm:**
   ```
   Both players: confirm trade
   ```

5. **Trade executes atomically:**
   - Items and gold exchanged simultaneously
   - Trade logged for history
   - Both notified of completion

**Safety features:**
- Trade cancels if player moves rooms
- Trade cancels if player logs out
- 60-second timeout on acceptance
- 5-minute timeout on confirmation
- Both players see exactly what they're getting

## 📊 Database Collections

The system creates these Firestore collections automatically:

### `mud-merchant-reputation`
Stores player reputation with each merchant:
```json
{
  "playerId_merchantId": {
    "playerId": "user123",
    "merchantId": "blacksmith",
    "points": 250,
    "lastUpdated": 1729389600000
  }
}
```

### `mud-active-trades`
Stores ongoing player trades:
```json
{
  "tradeId": {
    "initiatorId": "user123",
    "partnerId": "user456",
    "roomId": "town-square",
    "initiatorOffer": {
      "items": [{"id": "sword", "name": "iron sword"}],
      "gold": 50,
      "confirmed": false
    },
    "partnerOffer": {
      "items": [],
      "gold": 100,
      "confirmed": false
    },
    "status": "active",
    "createdAt": 1729389600000
  }
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "There's no one here to buy from"
- Ensure NPC has `sells` array
- Check NPC is in same room as player
- Verify NPC object exists in gameNpcs

### "Merchant isn't selling that"
- Check item ID is in NPC's `sells` array
- Verify item exists in gameItems
- Use `list` to see what's available

### "Merchant doesn't buy items"
- Add `buys` array to NPC
- Set `buyRate` (typically 0.30-0.70)
- Use "all" to buy everything

### Haggling doesn't work
- Ensure `haggleable: true` on NPC
- Check player has CHA stat
- Verify merchant has `greed` property

### Player trades failing
- Check both players in same room
- Ensure items exist in inventory
- Verify enough gold for offers
- Check items aren't bound
- Confirm Firebase rules allow writes
