# Class-Specific Leveling System

## Overview
Each character class now has unique leveling progression, making class choice meaningful and strategic. Classes level at different rates, gain different amounts of HP/MP, and have specialized stat growth patterns.

## Leveling Properties

### XP Multiplier
Determines how fast a class levels up relative to the base progression.

- **Rogue**: 0.90 (fastest leveling, -10% XP required)
- **Warrior**: 0.95 (fast leveling, -5% XP required)
- **Ranger**: 0.95 (fast leveling, -5% XP required)
- **Priest**: 1.00 (standard leveling)
- **Paladin**: 1.05 (slow leveling, +5% XP required)
- **Wizard**: 1.10 (slowest leveling, +10% XP required)

**Example**: At level 10, base XP required is ~3,162:
- Rogue needs: 2,846 XP (fastest)
- Warrior needs: 3,004 XP
- Priest needs: 3,162 XP
- Wizard needs: 3,478 XP (slowest)

### HP Per Level
How much maximum HP increases each level.

### MP Per Level
How much maximum MP increases each level.

## Tips and Strategies

### Early Game (Levels 1-10)
- **Choose Rogue or Warrior** for fastest progression
- Focus on killing monsters for XP
- Class differences are minor at low levels

### Mid Game (Levels 11-20)
- Class specializations become apparent
- **Warriors** have significant HP advantage
- **Wizards** struggle with low HP but high MP
- Stat differences start affecting combat

### Late Game (Levels 21-30)
- Class identity fully realized
- **Wizards** are powerful but took longer to get there
- **Warriors** are tanky powerhouses
- **Rogues** have best crit rate and dodge
- Specialized stat growth creates distinct playstyles

### PvP Considerations
- **Warriors**: High HP, hard to kill
- **Rogues**: High dodge and crit, burst damage
- **Wizards**: Future spell power (when implemented)
- **Priests**: Best dodge, support role
- **Paladins**: Jack-of-all-trades, reliable
- **Rangers**: Consistent damage, good dodge

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Class-specific abilities** unlocked at certain levels
- **Prestige classes** after reaching max level
- **Dual-classing** system
- **Class quests** for unique rewards
- **MP-based spell system** (spells cost MP to cast)
- **Class balance updates** based on gameplay data

## Adding New Classes

To add a new class, add these properties to the class definition:

```javascript
{
    name: 'Class Name',
    description: 'Class description',
    statBonuses: { str: 0, dex: 0, con: 0, int: 0, wis: 0, cha: 0 },
    hpBonus: 0,        // Starting HP bonus (positive or negative)
    mpBonus: 0,        // Starting MP bonus
    abilities: [],     // Array of ability names
    xpMultiplier: 1.0, // XP rate (0.9 = faster, 1.1 = slower)
    hpPerLevel: 10,    // HP gained per level
    mpPerLevel: 5,     // MP gained per level
    statGrowth: {      // Levels per +1 stat (lower = faster)
        str: 3,
        dex: 3,
        con: 3,
        int: 3,
        wis: 3,
        cha: 3
    }
}
```

## Testing

To test class progression:
1. Create characters of different classes
2. Use admin panel to grant XP
3. Verify HP/MP gains match expected values
4. Check stat growth at various levels
5. Compare leveling speed across classes
