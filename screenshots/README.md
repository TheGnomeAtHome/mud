# Screenshots for PWA

Screenshots are optional but recommended. They appear when users are prompted to install the app.

## What You Need

1. **gameplay.png** - 1280x720 (desktop/landscape view)
   - Take a screenshot of the game in action
   - Show the terminal with some gameplay

2. **mobile.png** - 720x1280 (mobile/portrait view)
   - Take a screenshot on your phone
   - Show the game interface

## How to Create

### Desktop Screenshot:
1. Open the game in your browser
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools
3. Click the "Device Toolbar" icon (or Ctrl+Shift+M)
4. Set dimensions to 1280x720
5. Take screenshot (Windows: Win+Shift+S, Mac: Cmd+Shift+4)

### Mobile Screenshot:
1. Open game on your phone
2. Take a screenshot
3. Crop to 720x1280 if needed

## Optional

Screenshots are not required for the PWA to work. They just make the install prompt look better.

You can remove the "screenshots" section from manifest.json if you don't want to add them.
