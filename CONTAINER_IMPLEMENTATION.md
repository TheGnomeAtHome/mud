# Container & Weight System Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Weight Calculation System
**Location**: `js/game.js` (before handleSpecialItem function)

**Functions Added:**
- `calculateInventoryWeight(inventory)` - Calculates total weight of all items
- `calculateMaxCarryWeight(playerData)` - Calculates player's max capacity
- `canCarryItem(playerData, itemId, quantity)` - Checks if player can carry item

**Formula:**
```
Max Capacity = 50 (base) + (Strength × 5) + Container Bonuses
```

### 2. Container Item Type
**Location**: `js/game.js` - handleSpecialItem function, case 'container'

**Features:**
- Open containers to view contents
- Display capacity usage (current/max lbs)
- Auto-initialize contents array
- Show hints for put/take commands

**Properties:**
- `itemType: "container"`
- `weight` - How much container weighs
- `specialData.capacity` - Max weight it can hold
- `specialData.capacityBonus` - Increases player carrying capacity when equipped
- `contents` - Runtime array of stored items

### 3. Put Command
**Location**: `js/game.js` - Added after 'lock' case

**Syntax**: `put [item] in [container]`

**Features:**
- Validates item and container exist
- Checks container capacity
- Prevents putting container in itself
- Updates both inventory and container contents
- Shows success message

### 4. Take Command
**Location**: `js/game.js` - Added after 'put' case

**Syntax**: `take [item] from [container]`

**Features:**
- Validates container and item exist
- Checks player weight capacity
- Removes from container, adds to inventory
- Shows success/error messages
- Handles weight calculations

### 5. Enhanced Get Command
**Location**: `js/game.js` - case 'get'

**Changes:**
- Added weight limit checking before pickup
- Fetches fresh player data
- Uses `canCarryItem()` validation
- Shows detailed error with current/max weights
- Provides hints about storing items

### 6. Enhanced Inventory Command
**Location**: `js/game.js` - case 'inventory'

**Changes:**
- Shows weight for each item
- Displays equipped status
- Shows container contents count
- Total weight / max capacity
- Percentage used
- Warning messages at 75%/90% capacity

### 7. AI Command Parser Updates
**Location**: `js/ai.js`

**Changes:**
- Added "put" and "take" to valid actions list
- Added examples for container commands:
  - `put sword in backpack` → `{action: "put", target: "sword in backpack"}`
  - `take sword from backpack` → `{action: "take", target: "sword from backpack"}`
  - `open backpack` → `{action: "use", target: "backpack"}`

## Files Created

### 1. containers-example.json
**Location**: `data/containers-example.json`

Contains 6 example container items:
- Small Pouch (10 lbs capacity)
- Leather Backpack (50 lbs, +20 bonus)
- Adventurer's Satchel (30 lbs, +15 bonus)
- Spell Component Pouch (15 lbs, +5 bonus)
- Military Duffel Bag (100 lbs, +50 bonus)
- Wooden Chest (200 lbs capacity)

## Player Commands Added

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|

## Key Features

### Weight System
✅ Every item can have a `weight` property (lbs)
✅ Player capacity based on Strength stat
✅ Automatic weight checking on pickup
✅ Visual feedback in inventory
✅ Warning messages at 75%/90% capacity

### Container Storage
✅ Multiple container types with different capacities
✅ Items stored in container `contents` array
✅ Container weight + contents weight calculated
✅ Prevents container recursion (can't put in itself)
✅ Capacity limits enforced

### Carrying Capacity
✅ Base capacity: 50 lbs
✅ Strength bonus: Strength × 5 lbs
✅ Container bonuses: From equipped containers
✅ Dynamic calculation based on stats
✅ Shows current/max in inventory

### Player Experience
✅ Clear error messages
✅ Helpful hints when blocked
✅ Weight displayed for all items
✅ Percentage capacity used
✅ Container contents count

## Data Schema

### Container Item Template
```json
{
  "id": "leather_backpack",
  "name": "Leather Backpack",
  "description": "A sturdy leather backpack...",
  "itemType": "container",
  "weight": 3,
  "value": 25,
  "movable": true,
  "specialData": {
    "capacity": 50,
    "capacityBonus": 20,
    "description": "..."
  }
}
```

### Container Instance (Runtime)
```json
{
  "id": "leather_backpack",
  "name": "Leather Backpack",
  "equipped": true,
  "contents": [
    {"id": "iron_sword", "name": "Iron Sword", ...},
    {"id": "health_potion", "name": "Health Potion", ...}
  ]
}
```

### Item with Weight
```json
{
  "id": "iron_sword",
  "name": "Iron Sword",
  "weight": 5,
  "...": "..."
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Weight System
- [ ] Create character with different Strength values
- [ ] Verify capacity formula: 50 + (Strength × 5)
- [ ] Try picking up items at capacity limit
- [ ] Check error messages show correct weights

### Container Operations
- [ ] Get a container item
- [ ] Use/open container to view contents
- [ ] Put items in container
- [ ] Take items from container
- [ ] Try to put container in itself (should fail)
- [ ] Try to exceed container capacity (should fail)

### Inventory Display
- [ ] Check inventory shows weights
- [ ] Verify total weight calculation
- [ ] Test percentage display
- [ ] Confirm warning messages at 75%/90%

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Items without weight property (default 0)
- [ ] Empty containers
- [ ] Full containers
- [ ] Taking item at weight limit
- [ ] Container bonus from equipped containers

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **Quest System**: Weight-based collection quests possible
- **Trading System**: Container items as merchant inventory
- **Combat System**: Future - encumbrance affects stats
- **Class System**: Strength stat determines capacity
- **NPC System**: NPCs can give containers as rewards

### Future Enhancements
- Equip command for containers
- Weight affects movement/combat
- Bulk commands (put all, take all)
- Auto-organize containers
- Container upgrades/enchantments
- Shared storage (guild banks)
- Weight-based puzzles

## Performance Notes

- Weight calculations are efficient (simple loops)
- Container contents stored per instance (no extra DB calls)
- Validation happens before DB updates
- No impact on existing item functionality

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Games
1. **Items keep working** - Weight defaults to 0
2. **No data loss** - Existing inventories unchanged
3. **Gradual adoption** - Add weights to items over time
4. **Backward compatible** - Old items work with new system

### Adding to Existing Items
```javascript
// Just add weight property
{
  "id": "existing_item",
  // ... existing properties ...
  "weight": 5  // Add this line
}
```
